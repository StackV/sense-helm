# SENSE Helm Charts

A simple and central place for distribution of helm charts for the SENSE Orchestrator platform.


The SENSE-O deployment is container based and both Docker Stack or Kubernetes can be used. This repo is focused on artifacts for the Kubernetes deployment. SENSE-O consists of two major comonnents: the orchestrator server and the keycloak SSO server that can be separately deployed. The below diagram shows the structure of the overall deployment with a breakdown into the orchestrator and keycloak charts. Detailed intructions are provided for both in their respective folders in this repo.
